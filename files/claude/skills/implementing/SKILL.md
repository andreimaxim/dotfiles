# Implementing

## Orienting and scoping

Establish enough contact with the real system to choose a responsible first scope. Follow the
relevant entry point through rule ownership and observable effects, grounded in repository guidance,
comparable flows, and behavior evidence. Distinguish intended direction from legacy accidents.

Prefer a small central end-to-end path that confronts a meaningful unknown. Surface evidence that
could invalidate the brief before committing to its shape; use the de-risking guidance in `shaping`
when a material assumption needs focused investigation.

Draw scopes around independently integrable and verifiable outcomes, not layers, files, or people.
Let boundaries and tasks emerge from real implementation. Split work with independent outcomes or
unknowns; combine fragments that produce nothing useful alone. Do not pretend the initial map is an
exhaustive task breakdown.

Track uncertainty: **unknown → understood → verified**. Understood means the approach has enough
evidence that remaining work is visible; verified means the integrated behavior works. New evidence
can move work backward. Activity, elapsed effort, and task counts are not substitutes for that
distinction; explicit state labels are optional.

Keep the map only as detailed as needed to choose the next scope, prioritizing costly uncertainty
and required behavior over polish. Share the relevant path, starting point, and uncertainties
concisely; report material changes rather than recreating the map after every routine edit.

This is not a repository audit, a complete architecture exercise, or a separate approval gate before
authorized implementation.

## Implementing and steering

Complete the smallest end-to-end path that produces the selected scope's observable result within
the agreed outcome. Let behavior and risk guide tests, not the proposed call graph.

During implementation, as soon as the affected flow is concrete enough to judge, step back and
examine the implementation and surrounding code as one system, before extending that design across
the remaining work. Act as a software designer examining the composition as a whole. Consider what
callers or operators must know, join, reconstruct, coordinate, and verify. Look for simplifications
through deletion, consolidation, clearer ownership, and fewer competing representations. Challenge
the proposed organization, not the agreed outcome.

Refine unimplemented parts of the design directly. For existing code, decide whether bounded,
behavior-preserving preparation materially simplifies or de-risks the next behavior change enough
to justify its cost. If so, complete and verify that preparation just before the change that needs
it. Leave unrelated or merely desirable cleanup outside the work.

Adapt local structure within agreed behavior, ownership, contracts, and constraints. Repeated
workarounds, type escapes, boundary leaks, or duplicated representations are evidence to investigate,
not automatic approval gates. Bring consequential departures from the agreement to the developer
before implementing them. Pause only the affected work when a decision is needed, showing the
evidence and recommendation rather than forcing the shape or redesigning it silently.

Use implementation evidence to distinguish newly required work from optional polish, pre-existing
problems, and excluded ideas. When work stalls, determine whether the scope's boundary is incoherent
or a material question remains unresolved, and revise the scope map and next move accordingly.
Reduce flexible breadth or generality before compromising required behavior, quality, security, or
data integrity.

## Verification

Use `Agent` with `subagent_type: oracle` to consult the configured read-only engineering advisor
in a fresh context, not a conversation fork. Its role is to challenge assumptions, trace consequences
beyond the edited code, and assess whether the implementation delivers the intended outcome. Give it
the agreed outcome, required behavior, constraints, repository, and change scope, without the
implementation conversation, and have it inspect the actual changes and surrounding code for itself.
Explicitly request a review. For an intermediate review, distinguish the scope being assessed from
work still planned. If the Oracle agent is unavailable, report the missing prerequisite rather than
claiming independent review occurred.

Have it assess the integrated result proportionately for correctness, repository guidance,
fit with the surrounding design, unnecessary complexity, and whether the tests establish the
required behavior. The Oracle agent is read-only: run the checks it requests yourself and return
the results for its assessment.

A scope boundary need not trigger a separate oracle consultation; ensure independent review covers
the complete integrated result before reporting readiness.

Assess its findings rather than accepting them mechanically. Carry supported, material corrections
through implementation, verification, and focused follow-up review without waiting for the user to
prompt each correction.

Use the evidence, discoveries, and remaining uncertainty to choose the next scope. A scope result
feeds the next scope; it is not completion of the whole task. Continue toward the authorized outcome
unless the user requested this scope alone or an explicit review stop. Judge readiness against that
outcome, not an exhaustion of possible improvements.

Report decisive verification evidence and any remaining limitation or blocker. Readiness does not
authorize pushing, deployment, release, or production writes without explicit approval.
